# V2-Noughts-and-Crosses

## Objectives

Improve on version one through the following changes:

1. Improved modular code, particularly separating out tasks ('single responsibity principle') - V1 includes game logic bleeding into domController module.
2. Improve understanding of design patterns by selecting approach for interaction between different modules e.g. mediator pattern (game logic module routing communicaton between game board, players etc.? Yet to research and review fully) or strategy pattern (useful if developing AI and different moves e.g. play center first, block oppoonet's three etc?)
3. Use 'class' and accessor fields with private variables for more secure gamestate object which can't be accessed directly.
